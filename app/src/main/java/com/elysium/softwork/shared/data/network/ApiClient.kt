/**
 * Process-wide Retrofit instance. Bounded contexts retrieve their typed WebService through
 * [retrofit] and call `create(MyWebService::class.java)` from their store implementation.
 *
 * Configuration sources (all compile-time, never embedded as Kotlin literals):
 *
 * - `BuildConfig.BACKEND_BASE_URL` — fed by the Secrets Gradle Plugin from
 *   `secrets.properties` (gitignored) with a fallback to `secrets.defaults.properties`
 *   (committed). The base URL is the **single source of truth**; WebService interfaces
 *   must only declare relative paths.
 * - `BuildConfig.API_KEY_GEMINI` / `API_KEY_EXTERNAL_SERVICE` — consumed by
 *   [ApiKeyInterceptor] to attach third-party credentials on a per-host basis.
 *
 * The session JWT is attached by [AuthInterceptor], which resolves the token through
 * [tokenProvider] **on every single request** — never a value captured in a field at build
 * time. `ServiceLocator` wires the provider to read `SharedPrefsManager.KEY_AUTH_TOKEN` live,
 * so each out-of-bounds call (the sequential `employee-profile` lookup, then the membership
 * endpoints, …) re-reads the current session state from disk. A token saved a moment earlier
 * by `sign-in` / `sign-up` is therefore visible to the very next call, and a logout stops
 * authorizing immediately — with no stale per-client cache to leak.
 *
 * There is intentionally **no** cached `authToken` field: caching the token reference is what
 * lets a later async call (e.g. `membership-plans`) ship without the header while an earlier
 * one (`employee-profile`) carried it. The single shared [okHttpClient] is reused by every
 * WebService, so this one live-reading interceptor governs the whole app.
 *
 * This object keeps its no-`Context` `object` shape; the provider closure is the only state.
 *
 * Debug builds get an [HttpLoggingInterceptor] at `BODY` level for inspecting requests in
 * Logcat; release builds omit it entirely (the dependency is `debugImplementation` only).
