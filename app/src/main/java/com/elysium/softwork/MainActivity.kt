/**
 * Single Activity hosting the entire Compose UI tree.
 *
 * Inherits from [AppCompatActivity] so that [androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatDelegate.setApplicationLocales]
 * automatically recreates the activity with the new configuration on API 29-32 (the AppCompat
 * back-port path). On API 33+ the platform `LocaleManager` handles recreation transparently;
 * the AppCompat dependency is harmless on those versions.
 *
 * The Activity hands off all routing to [AppRoot], which is what inspects the
 * authentication and membership flags and chooses between the auth host, the payment
 * onboarding host, and the main shell. Keeping the routing in a child composable means
 * the outer [Surface] measures and paints the brand background before any state-flow
 * collector is attached — avoiding a transient black frame on slower devices where the
 * collector would otherwise compete with the initial layout pass.

     *     transparent system-bar configuration is installed on the window decor before
     *     the platform attaches the Activity's content view. Calling it later allows the
     *     platform to paint one frame with the theme's opaque status / navigation bar
     *     over a yet-undrawn Compose tree.
     *  2. `super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)` runs immediately after, so the rest of
     *     the Activity lifecycle proceeds normally.
     *  3. [setContent] installs the Compose tree with [SoftWorkTheme] at the root and a
     *     full-screen [Surface] as the **immediate** child. The surface guarantees the
     *     window paints the brand background on the very first frame, even if the
     *     downstream routing composable takes a frame to settle its state collectors.

     * outer [Surface] is not blocked by the seeded `SharedPreferences` read used to
     * derive the initial value of the [rememberSaveable] authentication flag or by the
     * attachment of the [collectAsStateWithLifecycle] collector on the membership flow.
     * Both happen inside this child composable's first composition, by which point the
     * parent surface has already been measured and painted.
     *
     * The routing fans out into one of three top-level hosts based on two boolean
     * flags:
     *  - [AuthNavHost] when the worker is unauthenticated.
     *  - [PaymentOnboardingHost] when authenticated without an active membership.
     *  - [MainNavHost] when authenticated AND a membership is active.
     *
     * **No recomposition loop is possible here.** The two flags are never mutated from
     * inside a composable body — only from inside lambdas passed to children
     * ([onAuthComplete], [onLogout]) and from inside a `LaunchedEffect` scheduled by
     * `PaymentSuccessScreen` after membership activation. Both mechanisms write the
     * state *after* composition completes, so no branch of the `when` below can
     * trigger an immediate re-entry into itself.
     *
     * The membership flag is collected from the application-wide membership store. The
     * host swap on cancel / activation therefore happens reactively without any
     * explicit `popUpTo`.
