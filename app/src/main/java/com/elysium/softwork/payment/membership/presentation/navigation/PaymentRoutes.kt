/**
 * Route catalog for the payment and membership bounded context.
 *
 * The graph is mounted in two host contexts:
 *  - As a standalone onboarding host at the application root when an authenticated worker
 *    has no active membership. Entry point is [SELECTION].
 *  - Nested inside the authenticated main shell when the worker enters through the
 *    profile settings ("Payment methods"). Entry point is [methods] with
 *    `fromSettings = true`, which surfaces the "Cancel subscription" action.
 *
 * Route templates use embedded path arguments. The graph declares the matching
 * `navArgument` types in `PaymentNavigation.kt`, so callers only need to build route
 * strings through the helper functions exposed here ([methods], [success]).
